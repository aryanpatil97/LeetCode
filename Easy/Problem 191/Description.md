# 191. Number of 1 Bits

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 11 (00000000000000000000000000001011)
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**
- The input must be a binary string of length 32.

**Approach:**
- Use bit manipulation to count the number of 1s.
